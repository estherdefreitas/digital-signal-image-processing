## Current Task

**Task 1: Remove Green Background from Images**  

This Python program removes green backgrounds from images. Initially prototyped in [**Google Colab**](https://github.com/estherdefreitas/digital-signal-image-processing/blob/main/remove-green-background-from-images.ipynb?short_path=1702cef), then moved to a standalone [`.py` script](https://github.com/estherdefreitas/digital-signal-image-processing/blob/main/remove_green_bg.py). Processed images are saved as `.png`.

### Features

- Efficient green-screen background removal  
- Saves processed images as PNG  
- Uses `numpy`, `opencv-python`, `screeninfo`  
- Simple command-line usage

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/digital-signal-image-processing.git
   cd digital-signal-image-processing
   ```
2. Make sure you have the required libraries installed:
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python numpy
   ```
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python remove_green_bg.py
   ```
## Repository Structure
   ```bash
   digital-signal-image-processing.ipynb # Colab notebook
   remove_green_bg.py   # Main Python script
  ```
## Future Plans
   - Add support for other background colors
   - Receive images to be processed as a command-line parameter when running the program
   - Explore advanced image processing techniques for upcoming coursework

This repository demonstrates my skills in Python, image processing, and problem-solving, showcasing projects from my Bachelor's coursework
